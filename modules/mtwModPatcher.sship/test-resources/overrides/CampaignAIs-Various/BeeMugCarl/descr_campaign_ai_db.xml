		// The trusted ally global parameters specify the minimum faction standing thresholds for a target faction to be 
		// considered a trusted ally.  We can use target faction standing parameters directly in invasion/defend decisions
		// but the trusted ally data allows us to use additional entry parameters: trusted_ally_enemy and trusted_ally_protectorate
		// that we cannot measure directly for a target faction.  An AI faction may also try and aid its trusted allies (hence the 
		// reverse checks on standings to avoid helping allies it shouldn't)

		<trusted_ally_fs_threshold float="0.4"/>                // min threshold for how much we like the target faction to consider them a trusted ally

		// Each faction has an 'ai_label' specified in the campaign descr_strat.txt.  This ai_label must correspond to a 'faction_ai_label' 
		// entry specified in this database (e.g. 'default', 'catholic', 'papal_states').  The 'default' ai_label should always exist 
		// and is used if a specified ai_label cannot be found.  Note that each ai_label is independent (i.e. 'catholic' ai_label does
		// not inherit any data from 'default') hence care should be taken when adding new entries to ensure that any relevant global
		// entries are added to all other ai_labels.  Additionally, the ai_labels can be tested through event conditions and set through
		// a script command, potentially allowing ai behaviour to be changed dynamically in game depending on current game state.

		<faction_ai_label name="default">	:: The label for a following set of campaign ai faction parameters
		

		// The ai_labels specify the structure of the long term goal director (LTGD) which drives the high level campaign AI.
		// At the start of every factions turn (or when diplomacy changes), the LTGD is re-evaluated as follows:
			// for every target faction (all other factions), evaluate the defend decisions
			// for every target faction, evaluate the invasion decisions
			// any invasion priorities are modified by the faction standing (relationship) towards the target
			// depending on current game state, a new target with a high invasion priority may be selected to invade
		// the LTGD can be debugged with the preferences '[log] level = ai.ltgd trace' and '[ai] ltgd_logging = true.

			
		// The 'defend_decisions' entry specifies a list of decision entries related to ai defence strategies.  To evaluate a defence
		// strategy, a set of parameters is built and the list of decision entries is iterated until an entry satisfies the min and max
		// conditions for the set of parameters.  As soon as an entry is satisfied (min <= current <= max), the iteration ends.  The decision
		// is taken from the default 'faction_attitude' parameters with certain parameters overridden.  The 'min_entry' specifies the minimum
		// thresholds specified for evaluation and the 'max_entry' specifies the maximum.  Note that care should be taken when entering new 
		// entries since as soon as the thresholds for an entry are successfully met, the iteration ends.  An exception to this is the use of
		// the 'continue' faction_attitude parameter, which allows the decision iteration to continue (This is useful for changing certain
		// parameters of the faction_attitude but allowing the process to continue so other entries can apply additional modifications).
